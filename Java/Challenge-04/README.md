# Singly Linked List
the Linked list is  type of  data structure , the linked lise is contained a head and tail and multi nodes each node have value and nex node 

## Challenge
we want to create a Singly Linked List class it contain a some method (insert and include and to String ) and node class to create new node 

## Approach & Efficiency

i use a O(1) to  create all  method such as in the insert2 method i create tail that pointed to the last node in linked list

## API
## 1 - insert :
it takes int value and crate new node and add the new node as first element (make it as a head );
## 2 - includes : 
it take a int value and search on th value inside Linked list and return if true if exists and return false if not exists .


## 3 - printAllValue : 

it prints all value inside linked list this method is extra for me  .

## 4 - ToString : 

it prints all value as string with  formatted

example

```
"{ 1 } -> { 2 } -> { 3 } -> NULL"
```

## 4 - insert2 : 

it takes int value and create new node and add it as last element

# doubly-linked-list

i create i new package for double node and inside it tow  class for crate Double node and crate Doubleylinkelist
